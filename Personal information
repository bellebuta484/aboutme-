<h2 style="color:blue;"> Personal Information </h2>  
  
My name is Phimonrat Panaphong and my nickname is Belle, s3885709, s3885709@student.rmit.edu.au. 
I am originally from Bangkok, Thailand and live in Sydney, Australia. I am 37-year-old, and I am Buddhism. 
I graduated bachelor's degree in international business management from Thailand and had completed Diploma of Business Management in Sydney. 
I speak Thai, English and Spanish (fairly). I enjoy cooking, baking, listening to music, watching Korean drama, and re-arranging and organising wardrobe. 
I am Sagittarius and I am fair-minded, optimistic, hilarious, spontaneous, and honest. 
  
  
Interest in IT   
  
During the lock down, my husband got an identification stolen. He could not access to his emails and could not use his phone. 
We found out later that someone in Tasmania requested for his phone SIM card replacement. 
That moment I thought if I have a good knowledge about IT or at least know how the hacker penetrates. 
My husband would not experience the challenging time and terrified that someone will steal our finance or commit a fraud under his identity.  
  
  
Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 
  
According to the story above, I started to look for a good options and flexible courses. 
I found RMIT through Open University and when I found out that RMIT offer a 100% online bachelor's degree in IT. 
<p>I cannot let go of this opportunity and here I am &#128512;</p>
  
 
What do you expect to learn during your studies?  
  
As you know that I am a new learner in IT and I do have little knowledge about technology. 
I am expecting to learn more about creating website and comprehensive the functionality of hardware and software including cloud storage. Learning more about coding and programming would be a great benefit to the future career as well.
